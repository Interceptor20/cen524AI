## Project Overview

---

This project uses Linear Regression to predict credit risk based on credit score and income. The goal is to determine the likelihood of a loan being good or bad.

## Dataset

---

The dataset used for this project is `credit_data.csv`, which contains information on credit scores, income, and loan remarks (good or bad).

## Project Structure

---

- `credit_data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `creditscore.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## How to Run

---

1. Install the required libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) using pip.
2. Open the `creditscore.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run each cell in order to execute the code.

## Model Evaluation

---

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. The results are printed in the notebook.

## Conclusion

---

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression for credit risk prediction. The model's performance can be improved by tuning hyperparameters, feature engineering, and using other machine learning algorithms.
